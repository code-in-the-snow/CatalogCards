This is a C# / IronPython application to create library catalog-like cards for your books.  TARGET AUDIENCE: People who LOVE books, --watch-- The Big Bang Theory, and *covet* the beautiful card catalog in Sheldon and Leonard's livingroom.  

Users input an ISBN (it is assumed you have access to a physical copy of each book), and the project pulls details for the associated edition of the title from the Open Library API to format a printable catalog card as a Windows form.

Currently, Open Library is the sole data source for the project.  Please note the following limitations:
	The published date provided is the publication date for the specific edition of the title, NOT the original copyright date.
	I do not (yet) have date of birth and date of death for authors.
	I do not (yet) have a Summary for each title.
	
Below are side-by-side samples of a card purloined from a library and a card generated by my proeject:
